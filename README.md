# Contribution Spoofing

I found out you can manually set `GIT_AUTHOR/COMMITTER_DATE`,
which immediately gave me an opportunity to fill my contribution gap in 2024 with something amusing.

I did it by manually creating some pixel letters and
(tediously) mapping them onto the GitHub contributions calendar.

The rest is seen in the simple `run` script.
